## Installation
Manual installation of the PrestaShop 8 plugin using (s)FTP

1. Upload all of the folders in the ZIP file into the Modules folder of your PrestaShop installation (no files are transferred).
You can use an sFTP or SCP program, for example, to upload the files. There are various sFTP clients that you can download free of charge from the internet, such as WinSCP or Filezilla.
2. Go to your PrestaShop admin environment. Click ‘Improve' > 'Modules' > 'Module Catalog’ and search for NoPayn.
3. You will see several modules to be installed. Start with ‘nopayn’. Click Install / Proceed with the installation.
After installation, the module will move to Improve' > 'Modules' > 'Module Manager’
4. Configure the NoPayn module
- Enable the cURL CA bundle option.
This fixes a cURL SSL Certificate issue that appears in some web-hosting environments where you do not have access to the PHP.ini file and therefore are not able to update server certificates.
- Copy the API key

5. After you have installed the ‘NoPayn´ module, you can install the other modules you would like to offer in your webshop.
Enable only those payment methods that you applied for and for which you have received a confirmation from us.

Note that if a payment method has no specific configuration to be done apart from the ones in the generic configuration, the only option shown on the panel will be “Disable”/”Enable”.
The “configure” option is only shown in case the payment method has further configuration.
